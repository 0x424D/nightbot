So far, all coded commands work only in FrozenHiro's chat (https://www.twitch.tv/frozenhiro).

Command usage:
!crosshair / !crosshairs <hero>: Displays the specific settings the streamer has set for the crosshairs of the given hero. So far, only supports Overwatch characters. Supports some common aliases (e.g. "hog" for roadhog, "brig" for brigitte, etc). The command has also been given the alias "!crosshair" in FrozenHiro's chat; either can be used and will work identically.
!sens [game]: Displays the specific settings the streamer has set for the sensitivity of the supplied game, or for Overwatch if no game is specified (because FrozenHiro is primarily an Overwatch streamer). TODO: investigate whether nightbot stores the current game being played and if it does, cause the command to default to the current game when invoked without an argument.
